# WhiteBox

This project was made to serve the purpose of recording sensor readings for robotics by sending HTTP requests to a backend which will output the values into a MongoDB database.
By such, it can be used to read and view real time telemetry values and eliminate the requirement of recording the data onboard and processing it outside of the machine later on.
